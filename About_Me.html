    Hello World!

    My name is Osiris Diaz, 18-year-old student born and raised in the Dominican Republic.
    I am a first-year Software Engineering student here at RIT. I moved over to the Bronx 5 years ago after my mother married my now-stepfather who already lived here at the time.
    From there, I went off to study at Mott Hall Community School for my last year of middle school and then at New World High School for my 4 highschool years.
    There's a lot of activities I love doing: I am an avid videogame lover, currently playing far too many stuff at the same time (recently finished Portal 1 and 2 üëç).
    I enjoy writing, reading, theater/drama and most importantly, music! I've been singing (non-professionally) since I was a little kid, and music forms a regular part of my daily life.

    My favorite dish is Yaroa! It's a Dominican fast food consisting of french fries/plantains/cassava, layered with some form of meat and then another layer of cheese on top. It is often condimented with mayonaise and ketchup.

    To finish off, there are three things that I am hoping to get from this class:
    <ul>
        <li> How to code programs and applications</li>
        <li> The education and knowledge necessary to thrive in this field</li>
        <li> How to get a job</li>
    </ul>
    That's it from me bye'

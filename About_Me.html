Hello World!

My name is Osiris Diaz, 18-year-old student born and raised in the Dominican Republic. I am a first-year Software Engineering student here at RIT. I moved over to the Bronx 5 years ago after my mother married my now-stepfather who already lived here at the time. From there, I went off to study at Mott Hall Community School for my last year of middle school and then at New World High School for my 4 highschool years. There's a lot of activities I love doing: I am an avid videogame lover, currently playing far too many stuff at the same time (recently finished Portal 1 and 2 üëç). I enjoy writing, reading, theater/drama and most importantly, music! I've been singing (non-professionally) since I was a little kid, and music forms a regular part of my daily life.
